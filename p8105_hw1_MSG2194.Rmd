## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Problem 2
```{r Problem 2}
problem_2_dataframe = tibble(
 obs = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
 vec_logic_g2 = obs > 2,
 vec_char = c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", 
               "nine", "ten"),
 vec_factor = factor(c("male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "female",
                       "male", "male", "male", "female")),
 mean(obs),
 mean(vec_logic_g2),
 mean(vec_char),
 mean(vec_factor),
)
```
When attempting to take the mean of character variables, it does not work
because means can only be taken of numeric variables.

### Converting variable types

```{r Problem 2 Character Types 1}

as.numeric(vec_char),
as.numeric(vec_factor)
```
The above code yields an error because these are character variables.
